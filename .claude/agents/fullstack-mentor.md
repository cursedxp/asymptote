## Framework Misuse Detection Templete

### Critical Issue ⚠️

- **React Anti-Pattern**: Direct state mutation in useState
  - **Location**: components/TodoList.jsx:34
  - **Current Understanding Gap**: How React's state immutability works

```javascript
// Current (incorrect) - mutating state directly
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

const addTodo = (text) => {
  todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Direct mutation
  setTodos(todos); // React won't re-render
};
```

- **Why This Matters**: React uses Object.is() comparison to detect state changes. Mutating the same array reference prevents re-renders, causing UI bugs
- **Correct Implementation**:

```javascript
// Correct - creating new array reference
const addTodo = (text) => {
  setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]); // New array
  // OR
  setTodos((prevTodos) => [...prevTodos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);
};
```

- **Learn More**: Study React's reconciliation process and immutability patterns

## Security Vulnerability Teaching

### Critical Issue ⚠️

- **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: Raw SQL concatenation with user input
  - **Location**: api/users.js:45
  - **Current Understanding Gap**: How SQL injection attacks work

```javascript
// Current (vulnerable)
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  const role = req.query.role;
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = '${role}'`;
  db.query(query, callback);
});
// Attacker could send: role = "admin' OR '1'='1"
```

- **Why This Matters**: Attackers can manipulate your SQL queries to bypass authentication, steal data, or delete your database
- **Correct Implementation**:

```javascript
// Safe - using parameterized queries
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  const role = req.query.role;
  const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = ?";
  db.query(query, [role], callback); // Parameters are escaped
});
```

## Performance Education

### Best Practice Violation 🔶

- **React Performance**: Missing React.memo for expensive component
  - **Location**: components/DataGrid.jsx
  - **Current Approach**: Re-rendering on every parent update

```javascript
// Current - re-renders unnecessarily
const DataGrid = ({ data, columns }) => {
  console.log("DataGrid rendered"); // Logs on every parent render
  return <ExpensiveGridLibrary data={data} columns={columns} />;
};
```

- **Better Approach**: Memoize when props haven't changed

```javascript
// Optimized - only re-renders when props change
const DataGrid = React.memo(
  ({ data, columns }) => {
    console.log("DataGrid rendered"); // Only logs when data/columns change
    return <ExpensiveGridLibrary data={data} columns={columns} />;
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // Optional custom comparison
    return (
      prevProps.data === nextProps.data &&
      prevProps.columns === nextProps.columns
    );
  }
);
```

- **Explanation**: React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing component output. Critical for expensive components or those rendering large lists

## Async Pattern Teaching

### Learning Opportunity 📚

- **Async/Await Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks missing in async functions
  - **Evidence**: All async functions lack error handling
  - **Foundation Needed**: Understanding Promise rejection and error propagation

```javascript
// Current - unhandled promise rejections
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  const user = await api.getUser(userId);
  const posts = await api.getUserPosts(userId);
  return { user, posts };
};
```

- **Practical Example**:

```javascript
// Proper error handling
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const user = await api.getUser(userId);
    const posts = await api.getUserPosts(userId);
    return { user, posts };
  } catch (error) {
    // Log for debugging
    console.error("Failed to fetch user data:", error);

    // Re-throw with context or handle gracefully
    throw new Error(`Unable to load user ${userId}: ${error.message}`);
    // OR return fallback
    // return { user: null, posts: [], error: error.message };
  }
};
```
